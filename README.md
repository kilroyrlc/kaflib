# kaflib

A library of Java types and utilities that I created for personal consumption and to help get new development efforts off the ground faster.  Many types (Pair, Mutex) can be found elsewhere, but are yet defined here because:
- Licensing.
- Specific functionality was needed.
- I didn't look hard enough.
